# CIQ App `one_rep`
The CIQ application responsibilities and deliverables will be listed below as
they are added/developed.

## Local Set Up
1. [Install the SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/getting-started/)
2. Install Monkey C extension in VS Code (made by Garmin)
3. Run 'Run without Debugging'
    - If this is failing, you may need to generate a new developer key for your local machine. Enter the command pallet (`CTRL + P` -> `>`) and type 'developer key' (it will be prefaced by Monkey C) and place in the one_rep folder
